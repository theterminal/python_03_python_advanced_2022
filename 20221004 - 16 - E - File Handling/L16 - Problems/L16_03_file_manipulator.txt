Create a program that will receive commands until the command â€œEnd".
The commands can be:

    ->>> "Create-{file_name}"
          Creates the given file with an empty content.
          If the file already exists, remove the existing text in it (as if the file is created again)

    ->>> "Add-{file_name}-{content}"
          Append the content and a new line after it.
          If the file does not exist, create it, and add the content

    ->>> "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}"
          Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string with the new string.
          If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"

    ->>> "Delete-{file_name}"
          Delete the file.
          If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
