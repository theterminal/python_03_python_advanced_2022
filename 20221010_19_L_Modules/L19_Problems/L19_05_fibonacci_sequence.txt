05 - Fibonacci Sequence


Create a module that can create a Fibonacci sequence up to a number (count of numbers in the sequence) and print them,
separating them with a single space.

The module should also be able to locate a specific number in the sequence.
You can read more about the Fibonacci sequence here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

You will be receiving commands until the "Stop" command.

The commands are:

*) "Create Sequence {count}" - Create a series of numbers up to a specific count and print them in the following format:

"{n1} {n2} â€¦ {n}"

*) "Locate {number}" - Check if the sequence contains the number.
    - If it finds the number, it should print:      "The number - {number} is at index {index}"
    - And if it doesn't find it:                    "The number {number} is not in the sequence"


Input:
------
You will be receiving commands until the "Stop" command. All inputs will be valid.


Output:
------
Print the output of every command in the format described above.


________________ Test Data _________________


Input 1:
-------
Create Sequence 10
Locate 13
Create Sequence 3
Locate 10
Stop


Output 1:
--------
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
The number - 13 is at index 7
0 1 1
The number 10 is not in the sequence
