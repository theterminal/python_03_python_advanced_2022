20221014 - Python - Python Advanced - Exam Preparation 02
01 - Stewards - judge: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/3534#0


As you know, stewards are needed for every single flight.
Today you will be that one steward, and you will be assisting the passengers in finding their seats.

You will be given a sequence of 6 seats - every seat is a mix of a number and a letter in the format

“{number}{letter}".

You will also be given two more sequences of numbers only.

First, you have to take the first number of the first sequence and the last number of the second sequence.
Next, take the sum of those two numbers and find its ASCII character.

    *) Compare each of the two taken numbers and the found character with the seats.
       If you find a match, the passenger is seated, and the seat is considered taken.
       Remove both numbers from their sequences.

    *) If there is no equality, the two numbers should be returned at the end of their sequences (first becomes last, last becomes first).

    *) If you match an already taken seat, you should just remove both numbers from their sequences.

Each time you take numbers from the sequences and try to match them, you make one rotation. You should keep track of all rotations made.

The program should end under the following circumstances:
    *) You have found 3 (three) seat matches
    *) You have made a total of 10 rotations


Input
-----
On the first line, you will be given a sequence of seats - strings separated by comma and space ", "
On the second and the third line, you will be given two more sequences - integers separated by a comma and a space ", "


Output
------
When the program ends, print the following on two different lines:
Seat matches: {matches separated by comma and space}
Rotations count: {total rotations made}


Constraints
-----------
All integers will be in the range [1, 100]
All letters will be in the range [A-Z]
You will never run out of numbers in your sequences before the program ends


___________________ Test Data ___________________


Input 1:
-------
17K, 20B, 3C, 15D, 31Z, 28F
20, 35, 15, 3, 2, 10
1, 15, 64, 53, 45, 46


Output 1:
--------
Seat matches: 20B, 15D, 3C
Rotations count: 4


Comment 1:
---------
1) Take the first number from the first sequence (20) and the last number from the second sequence (46).
   Then, sum the two numbers (66) - its ASCII character is "B".
   Check both combinations "20B" and "46B" with the seats.
   The seat "20B" matches the first combination,
   so remove both numbers (20 and 46) from the sequences and take the seat - it's no longer available for matching.

2) Take the next numbers - 35 and 45. Their sum matches the character "P". There are no matches.
   Return both numbers to the opposite side of the sequences.
   The sequences look the following way: "15, 3, 2, 10, 35" and "45, 1, 15, 64, 53”

3) Take the following numbers - 15 and 53. Their sum matches the character "D". The seat "15D" is matched.
   Remove numbers 15 and 53 from their sequences.

4) Take the following numbers - 3 and 64. Their sum matches "C". The seat "3C" is matched.
   Remove the numbers 3 and 64 from their sequences.

Three seats are matched - print the needed information and end the program.
