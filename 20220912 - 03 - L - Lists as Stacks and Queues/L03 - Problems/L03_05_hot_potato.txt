Hot Potato is a game in which children form a circle and toss a hot potato.
The counting starts with the first kid.
Every nth toss, the child holding the potato leaves the game.
When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato to the next kid.
It continues until there is only one kid left.

Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato.
On the first line, you will receive kids' names, separated by a single space.
On the second line, you will receive the 'n'-th toss (integer) in which a child leaves the game.

Print every kid who is removed from the circle in the format "Removed {kid}".
In the end, print the only kid left in the format "Last is {kid}"
