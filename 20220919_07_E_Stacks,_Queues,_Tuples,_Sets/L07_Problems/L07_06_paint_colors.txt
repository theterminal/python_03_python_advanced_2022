You will have to find all possible color combinations that can be used.
Write a program that finds colors in a string.

You will be given a string on a single line containing substrings
(separated by a single space) from which you will be able to form the following colors:
    -> Main colors: "red", "yellow", "blue"
    -> Secondary colors: "orange", "purple", "green"

To form a color, you should concatenate the first and the last substrings and check if you can get any of the above colors' names.
If there is only one substring left, you should use it to do the same check.

You can only keep a secondary color if the two main colors needed for its creation could be formed from the given substrings:
    -> orange = red + yellow
    -> purple = red + blue
    -> green = yellow + blue

Note: You could find some of the main colors needed to keep a secondary color after it is found.

When you form a color, remove both substrings.
Otherwise, you should remove the last character of each substring and return them in the middle of the original string.
If the string contains an odd number of substrings, you should put the substrings one position ahead.

For example, if you are given the string "re yellow bye" you could not form a color with the substring "re" and "bye",
so you should remove the last character and return them in the middle of the string: "r by yellow".

In the end, print out the list with colors in the order in which they are found.


Input:
-----
    -> Single line string


Output:
------
    - > The list with the collected colors


Constrains:
----------
    -> You will not receive an empty string
    -> Please consider only the colors mentioned above
    -> There won't be any cases with repeating colors


--------- Test Data ------------


Input 1:
-------
d yel blu e low redd


Output 1:
--------
['yellow', 'blue', 'red']


Comment 1:
---------
First, we take "d" and "redd".

After combining those substrings, we don't get any of the needed colors,
so we remove the last characters from both substrings and return them in the middle of the original string,
and it becomes "yel blu red e low".

After that, we take "yel" and "low" so the first color we add to our list is yellow,
and the string we are searching in looks as follows: "blu red e"

Then we take "blu" and "e", and since this color is one of the searched ones (blue), we add it to our collection,
and the state of the string is now "red".

We should take the last substring and check if it matches some of the colors, and since it does,
we add it (red) to our colors collection.

Finally, we print all the colors found: yellow, blue, and red in the format shown above.

Input 2:
-------
r ue nge ora bl ed


Output 2:
--------
['red', 'blue']


Comment 2:
---------
We don't keep orange because we don't have yellow in the final list with colors
(combining red and yellow gives us orange).

Input 3:
-------
re ple blu pop e pur d


Output 3:
--------
['red', 'purple', 'blue']
