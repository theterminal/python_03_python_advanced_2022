04 - Maximal Sum - judge url: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1835#3


Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix's dimensions and finds the 3x3 square with a maximum sum of its elements.
There will be no case with two or more 3x3 squares with equal maximal sum.


Input:
-----
On the first line, you will receive the rows and columns in the format "{rows} {columns}" â€“ integers in the range [1, 20]
On the following lines, you will receive each row with its columns - integers, separated by a single space in the range [-20, 20]


Output:
------
On the first line, print the maximum sum of the elements in the 3x3 square in the format "Sum = {sum}"
On the following 3 lines, print each element of the found submatrix, separated by a single space
