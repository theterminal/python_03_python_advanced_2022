# 04 - Water Dispenser - judge url: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1830#3


Write a program that keeps track of people getting water from a dispenser and the amount of water left at the end.

On the first line, you will receive the starting quantity of water (integer) in a dispenser.

Then, on the following lines, you will be given the names of some people who want to get water
(each on a separate line) until you receive the command "Start".

Add those people in a queue.

Finally, you will receive some commands until the command "End":

    -	"{liters}" - litters (integer) that the current person in the queue wants to get.
                     Check if there is enough water in the dispenser for that person.

        o	If there is enough water, print "{person_name} got water" and remove him/her from the queue.

        o	Otherwise, print "{person_name} must wait" and remove the person from the queue
            without reducing the water in the dispenser.

    -	"refill {liters}" - add the given litters in the dispenser.

In the end, print how many liters of water have left in the format: "{left_liters} liters left".


_______________ Test Data _________________


Input 1:
-------
2
Peter
Amy
Start
2
refill 1
1
End


Output 1:
--------
Peter got water
Amy got water
0 liters left


Comment:
-------
We create a queue with Peter and Amy.
After the start command, we see that Peter wants 2 liters of water (and he gets them).
The water dispenser is left with 0 liters.
After refilling, there is 1 liter in the dispenser.
So when Amy wants 1 liter, she gets it, and there are 0 liters left in the dispenser.
